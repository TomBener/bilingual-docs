# Heading 1

There’s no reason to think the staircase doesn’t extend upwards forever.[^fnen] The red alien a few steps above us on the staircase would see human consciousness the same way we see that of an orangutan—they might think we’re pretty impressive for an animal, but that of course we don’t actually begin to understand anything. Our most brilliant scientist would be outmatched by one of their toddlers. [@ho2014] To the green alien up there higher on the staircase, the **red alien** might seem as intelligent and conscious as a chicken seems to us. And when the green alien looks at us, it sees the simplest little pre-programmed [ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant).

[^fnen]: This is a footnote.

# 一级标题

没有理由认为楼梯不会永远向上延伸[^fncn]。楼梯上比我们高几步的红色外星人看到人类的意识，就像我们看到猩猩的意识一样——他们可能认为我们对于动物来说相当令人印象深刻，但是当然我们实际上并没有开始理解任何东西。我们最聪明的科学家将会被他们的一个蹒跚学步的孩子击败 [@ho2014]。对于楼梯上那个绿色的外星人来说，这个**红色的外星人**看起来就像我们眼中的小鸡一样聪明和有意识。当绿色外星人看着我们的时候，它看到的是最简单的预先编程的小[蚂蚁](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蚂蚁)。

[^fncn]: 这是一个脚注。

> We can’t conceive of what life higher on the staircase would be like, but absorbing the fact that higher stairs exist and trying to view ourselves from the perspective of one of those steps is the key mindset we need to be in for this exercise.

> 我们无法想象楼梯上的生活会是什么样子，但吸收高楼梯存在的事实，并试图从这些阶梯中的一个角度来看待我们自己，这是我们在这个练习中需要的关键心态。

## Heading 2

🗓️ For now, let’s ignore those much higher steps and just focus on the step right above us—that light green step. [@zhang2011] A species on that step might think of us like we think of a three-year-old child—emerging into consciousness through a blur of simplicity and naiveté. Let’s imagine that a representative from that species was sent to observe humans and report back to his home planet about them—what would he think of the way we thought and behaved? What about us would `impress` him? What would make him ~~cringe~~?

# 二级标题

🗓️ 现在，让我们忽略那些更高的台阶，只关注我们正上方的台阶——浅绿色的台阶 [@zhang2011]。处于这一阶段的物种可能认为我们就像我们认为的一个三岁的孩子一样——通过简单和天真的模糊处理进入意识。让我们想象一下，来自那个物种的一名代表被派去观察人类，并向他的母星汇报有关人类的情况——他会怎么看待我们的思想和行为方式？我们会给他留下什么`印象`？什么会让他~~畏缩~~？

### Heading 3

- Judges ruled in favor of prisoners about 65% of the time early in the day, but by late morning that rate dropped to nearly 0, regardless of the facts of the case.
- CEOs were more likely to use negative and irritable words on earnings calls held in the afternoon than those held in the morning regardless of the underlying numbers.
- In healthcare settings, workers were less likely to wash their hands and doctors were more likely to prescribe unnecessary [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic) in the afternoon, and endoscopists found half as many polyps in afternoon colonoscopies as they do in morning ones.

### 三级标题

- 法官的判决在当天早上 65% 的时间里有利于囚犯，但到上午晚些时候，这一比率下降到接近 0，与案件的事实无关。
- 与上午的电话会议相比，下午的电话会议中，CEO 们更可能使用负面和易怒的词汇，而不考虑潜在的数字。
- 医护人员较少洗手，医生较多在下午处方不必要的[抗生素](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/抗细菌药)，内窥镜检查员在下午的结肠镜检查中发现的息肉数目，只有早上的一半。
